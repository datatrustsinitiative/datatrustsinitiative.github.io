  <h4>The Data Trusts Initiative </h4>

  Our interactions in the workplace, at home or with public services
  are increasingly mediated by digital technologies. These
  technologies have great potential to boost economic growth and
  enhance our wellbeing, but these novel patterns of data use can also
  leave us vulnerable in new ways.

  Existing laws already provide a variety of data rights, but
  exercising them can demand considerable knowledge, time, and
  energy. These legislative frameworks also struggle to cope with a
  data environment where data can be used and re-used in different
  ways. These changing patterns of data use put pressure on our
  traditional forms of data governance.

  Reaping the benefits of data and digital technologies will require
  robust new institutions or frameworks that can allow data sharing -
  helping develop new data-enabled products and services - while
  protecting individual rights and freedoms. Data trusts offer a
  mechanism to achieve this goal.

  A data trust is a mechanism for individuals to take the data rights
  that are set out in law and pool these into an organisation - a
  trust - in which trustees make decisions about data use on their
  behalf. These trusts have received widespread attention in recent
  years from policymakers across the world. Further action is now
  needed to identify how data trusts could help tackle real-world data
  governance challenges and clarify the legal frameworks that can
  underpin this work.

  Supported by a donation from the [Patrick J McGovern
  Foundation](https://www.mcgovern.org), the Data Trusts Initiative
  will fund research and engagement activities at the interface of
  technology, policy and the law. By building a community of
  researchers and social entrepreneurs, the Initiative will shift
  discussions about data trusts from principle to practice.

  The Initiative is hosted by the University of Cambridgeâ€™s [Department
  of Computer Science and Technology](https://cst.cam.ac.uk) and organised in
  collaboration with the [University of
  Birmingham](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/schools/law/index.aspx)
