  <h4 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The Data Trusts Initiative </h4><p
  class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Our interactions in the
  workplace, at home or with public services are increasingly mediated
  by digital technologies. These technologies have great potential to
  boost economic growth and enhance our wellbeing, but these novel
  patterns of data use can also leave us vulnerable in new
  ways.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Existing
  laws already provide a variety of data rights, but exercising them
  can demand considerable knowledge, time, and energy. These
  legislative frameworks also struggle to cope with a data environment
  where data can be used and re-used in different ways. These changing
  patterns of data use put pressure on our traditional forms of data
  governance.&nbsp;</p><p class=""
  style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Reaping the benefits of data and
  digital technologies will require robust new institutions or
  frameworks that can allow data sharing - helping develop new
  data-enabled products and services - while protecting individual
  rights and freedoms. Data trusts offer a mechanism to achieve this
  goal.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">A data
  trust is a mechanism for individuals to take the data rights that
  are set out in law and pool these into an organisation - a trust -
  in which trustees make decisions about data use on their
  behalf. These trusts have received widespread attention in recent
  years from policymakers across the world. Further action is now
  needed to identify how data trusts could help tackle real-world data
  governance challenges and clarify the legal frameworks that can
  underpin this work.</p><p class=""
  style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Supported by a donation from the <a
  href="https://www.mcgovern.org">Patrick J McGovern Foundation</a>,
  the Data Trusts Initiative will fund research and engagement
  activities at the interface of technology, policy and the law. By
  building a community of researchers and social entrepreneurs, the
  Initiative will shift discussions about data trusts from principle
  to practice.&nbsp;</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The
  Initiative is hosted by the University of Cambridgeâ€™s <a
  href="">Department
  of Computer Science and Technology</a> and organised in
  collaboration with the <a
  href="">University of
  Birmingham</a>.</p><p class="" data-rte-preserve-empty="true"
