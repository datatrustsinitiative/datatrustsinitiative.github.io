overview_short: How might data trusts operate in cities and urban environments?
overview_long: >-
  Using cities as a lens through which to consider questions about the collectivisation of data rights, this project is investigating how a civil data trust might be created in Graz, Austria. By combining insights from urban law and data protection law, it hopes to identify how Urban Data Trusts can be made compatible with both the provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation and other regulatory interventions that influence the design and operation of urban environments. It will also explore the opportunities for sharing data between different city trusts.
