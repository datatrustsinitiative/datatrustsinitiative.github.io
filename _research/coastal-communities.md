overview_long: >-
  Bringing an architectural perspective to bear on the design of data institutions, this project is exploring the practical application of data trusts in a small-town coastal community, and the value that this type of governance can create for local communities. Topics of interest for this project include placemaking, civic engagement and governance, and the role of data in environmental stewardship and conservation. By engaging local communities, this project will identify the touchpoints that can bring citizen voices into decisions about data use.
