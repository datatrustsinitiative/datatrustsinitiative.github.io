  While Quebec is a Civil Law jurisdiction, its Civil Code makes provision for the creation of purpose-led trusts to address general interests or social concerns. The Quebec Trust offers an innovative legal solution to promote collective action, and this project aims to create a model constituting act for such a trust. This constituting act would identify the purpose for which the trust is established, the rights that might be transferred to the trust, and the accountability mechanisms required to oversee its operations.
