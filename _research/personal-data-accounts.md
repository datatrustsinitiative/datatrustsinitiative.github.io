  Moving data trusts from theory to practice will require better understandings of what can be settled in trust, how it is settled, and who will then govern it. This project proposes to create a proof-of-concept data trust, based on personal data accounts that provide an infrastructure for individuals to control their personal data. By creating this infrastructure, the project will explore the interaction between data trusts and data rights, using a hypothesised use case of social media data as a lens through which to explore these issues.
