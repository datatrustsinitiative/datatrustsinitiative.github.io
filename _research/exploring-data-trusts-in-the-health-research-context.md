overview_short: What do use cases tell us about operational strategies for data trusts?
overview_long: >-
  By reviewing recent attempts to establish new data institutions, this project will consider the technical, economic and legal issues that influence the operation of data trusts. Through four use cases, it will identify different strategies for operationalising data trusts and generate ideas to promote further development and practical implementations of the data trusts model. With data trusts remaining an active area of policy development in Germany, this work will feed into current policy debates about what frameworks can support the development of data trusts.
