about: Born in Scotland Data Trust will develop an infrastructure for trustworthy data stewardship around a pilot birth cohort study that ultimately seeks to tackle the economic and healthcare inequalities affecting communities in Scotland. Stewarding healthcare, administrative and social data collected from pregnant women and their children, this pilot project will explore how data trusts can give research participants, including young people, a voice in decisions about data use.
