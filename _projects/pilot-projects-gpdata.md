title: General Practioners Data Trust
short-overview: The General Practice Data Trust pilot aims to explore how to give back control of their data to people who have opted out of NHS Digitalâ€™s General Practice Data for Planning and Research (GPDPR) programme and provide an opportunity to participate in life saving research.

about: Answering the questions at the core of this pilot project will mean that any resulting General Practice Data Trust can achieve the overarching impacts of reassuring those who have currently opted out of the GPDPR that their health data will only be shared in accordance with their wishes; and reassuring researchers that the data set they are accessing is full, accurate and has been provided consensually. 
aims_objectives: |
  The GPDT aims to solves the fundamental problem that currently the
  GPDPR is incomplete due to the significant opt-out rate of over a
  million citizens concerned about how their data will be managed and
  used in it. As a result of this opt-out, a significant risk of bias
  has been introduced to the GPDPR which could render research invalid
  and lead to suboptimal, or even wrong, health planning and policy
  decisions.
 
  The GPDT pilot project explores how to provides a mechanism to
  minimise this bias by empowering citizens who have opted out to
  choose to share their data according to the terms settled on in the
  Trust.
