**This post explores how we might map the suitability of different data sharing structures to different types of data use**

Sharing data can bring a range of benefits for individuals,
organisations and society. It can help tailor products or services, make
business processes more efficient, and improve a range of public
services, from healthcare to transport and more. Achieving these
aspirations requires governance structures that enable data access,
while managing the rights and responsibilities associated with different
data types. Different forms of such structures exist. They are
differently suited to different purposes. The right data governance
framework is dependent on who is participating, what their objectives
are and what the nature of the data is.

It is important to emphasise at the outset that each of the data sharing
structures considered in this 'landscape' document -from contractual
terms for horizontal data sharing to data trusts, via data commons and
data coops- is valuable in its own right and fulfils an important
function. This guide provides a framework for identifying the type of
structure that might best suit different needs. It is presented in the
form of a series of questions. These questions are drawn from experience
in discussing data sharing arrangements with representatives from each
of the groups we mention above.

#### Question 1. Has the data been collected already? 

This feels like the most obvious question but like many obvious
questions, we sometimes forget to ask it. Data sharing agreements cannot
alone unpick the challenges that arise from confusion around consent. If
the data is already collected, then the originators of the data may have
rights over this data. Concomitantly, sophisticated processing may also
grant IP rights that constrain or limit the effectiveness of some data
sharing structures (see next question).

#### Question 2. Does the data give rise to rights? 

Broadly-speaking, two types of *rights* need to be taken into account
when considering the suitability of different data sharing structures:

1.  **Personal data rights**: in some jurisdictions citizens have
    (limited) rights to restrict processing and/ or delete their
    personal data, as well as portability and access rights.

2.  **IP rights**: depending on the level of sophistication, the
    processing of data can give rise to IP rights.

There are also many circumstances in which neither of these types of
rights apply to the data to be shared: consider data about the bottom of
the oceans, or data about the movement of endangered animals.

The impact of those three possibilities - personal rights / IP rights /
no rights - on the choice of data sharing structures is illustrated in
Figure 1 (below).

Figure 1: Decision tree for data sharing. The root node splits
agreements into those where the data has and hasn’t been collected. The
scope and nature of rights pertaining to the data is the next
branch.

#### Question 3. What legal and ethical obligations constrain data sharing? 

Legal and ethical obligations may affect the shape and implementation of
a particular data sharing structure.

When using a Data Commons, access to the data may need to be restricted
to take into account an ethical obligation to prevent unintended harms
(such as poachers having access to endangered animals' movement data) or
legal obligations (such as statutory obligations pertaining to national
security). Such controlled access can be achieved through technical
means, such as accreditation mechanisms.

When personal rights are at stake, both the legal and ethical
obligations in play and the values and aims of data sharing will affect
the choice between data trusts, data coops or 'databanks'. This leads to
the fourth and last question.

#### Question 4. What values and aims are sought through data sharing? 

The choice of data access agreement is shaped by the values and aims of
those creating it. Our simple framework, illustrated below, highlights
four types of considerations:

-   [Individual concerns]{preserve-html-node="true" style="color:red"},
    relating to the benefits that an individual or entity might seek to
    gain by sharing data.
-   [Societal concerns]{preserve-html-node="true" style="color:gold"},
    or the pursuit of 'social good' activities, including improvements
    to public services or the natural environment.
-   [Managing vulnerabilities]{preserve-html-node="true"
    style="color:green"}, often stemming from power asymmetries that are
    emergent or embedded in social relationships and that can be
    compounded through poorly governed use of data.
-   [Promoting enfranchisement]{preserve-html-node="true"
    style="color:blue"}, relating to the ability of individuals or
    groups to seek redress after mistreatment or to pursue
    representation in the digital environment.

Within these four considerations are embedded tensions, for example
between individual rights and those of wider society. These tensions and
trade-offs need to be actively managed in designing data governance
systems, recognising that resolution of these is not likely to be
possible. Different legal frameworks for managing data access have
different strengths and weaknesses in this respect.

When personal data is at stake, the following three data sharing
structures are more or less suited to each of these considerations (see
figure 2).

1.  **Data Coops**: the contractual underpinnings of data coops make
    them relatively easy to set up and well suited to empowering groups
    of individuals to obtain [individual
    goods]{preserve-html-node="true" style="color:red"} (such as
    financial returns) or services (such as the monitoring of health or
    education services) that they would not be able to secure without
    pooling their data. Data coops may to some extent facilitate the
    pursuit of [societal goods]{preserve-html-node="true"
    style="color:gold"} (such as health research) on an ad-hoc basis
    (depending on the contractual terms).
2.  **Public Databank**: (à la Sidewalk labs latest instantiation): The
    fact that this type of data institution is run or held by a public
    entity makes it particularly well suited to purposes relating to the
    furthering of [societal goods]{preserve-html-node="true"
    style="color:gold"}. Nothing prevents this type of institution from
    also endeavouring to facilitate the delivery of [individual
    goods]{preserve-html-node="true" style="color:red"} (like monitoring
    the quality of health services). This type of institution may seek
    to address or minimize the
    [vulnerabilities]{preserve-html-node="true" style="color:green"}
    that stem from data sharing. Its being a State-provided, monolithic
    type of institution may however hinder its ability to address some
    types of vulnerabilities and enfranchise marginalised groups.
3.  **Data Trusts**: Data Trusts distinguish themselves from data coops
    and public databanks not only through the level of legal safeguards
    they are able to provide (within the framework of trust law). They
    are also uniquely capable of any combination of these aims
    (depending on the focus of each particular data trust). This
    mechanism is well-placed to address concerns about
    [enfranchisement]{preserve-html-node="true" style="color:blue"}, by
    providing a mechanism for under-represented and potentially
    vulnerable groups of individuals to reverse the direction of
    consent: their data trustee will have the fiduciary responsibility
    to exercise their data rights in a way that promotes the aspirations
    set out in the terms of each trust.

*Figure 2: The four primary considerations when designing a data
governance structure for sharing personal data.*
Each of these structures has its roots in different areas of the law.
Data trusts draw from trust law, and raise novel questions at the
intersection of property law, data protection, and public law. Other
mechanisms -- such as repeatable terms and conditions, or data commons
-- pose challenges to contract law and similar mechanisms when
determining how best to accommodate the legal and ethical obligations
associated with data sharing. This 'landscape post' is meant as a
starting point: much work needs to be done in mapping the relationship
and complementarity between the different data sharing structures that
have been considered.
