When it comes to implementing data trusts, Québec’s law contains a
number of unique features and represents an exception in civil-law
jurisdictions mostly because its *Civil Code* includes a trust-like
institution: in French, a *fiducie*. One unique feature of Québec’s
trust law occurs in the form of social trusts: a purpose-trust without
designated beneficiaries. Indeed, this kind of trust exists for the sole
purpose set forth in a binding legal document called a “Constituting
Act.”

This blog underlines how social trusts are well designed for imagining
and creating data trusts and how to implement data governance mechanisms
into this legal framework. Our observations were made in the context of
two pilot projects aimed at creating data trusts in Québec and will
explore three features; a general interest purpose trust, flexibility
within permanence, responsibility, accountability and trust.  

## A general interest purpose trust

A social trust’s sole *raison d’être* is to pursue and achieve its
purpose. In the case of a social trust, this purpose must be for social
utility. What is social utility? Social utility is a purpose of general
interest, including cultural, philanthropic, educational or scientific.
The *Civil Code of Québec* provides that the main purpose of a social
trust cannot be to make a profit or to operate a
business.[^1] A social trust can operate a business, but it
must be solely to support its mission, not to make a profit.

[^1]: Article 1270 of the *Civil Code of Québec* provides that “\[The social trust\] does not have the making of profit or the operation of an enterprise as its essential object.”

The purpose of the trust plays a pivotal role in the governance of data
trusts and defines future use of data as well as the conditions to
access and share data with third parties. Trustees are bound by this
purpose, and all their actions or decisions must comply with it. Any
access given to third parties, any valuation of data or any sharing of
data will always be justified by a general interest purpose.

Thus, drafting the purpose is a crucial step in the creation of any
trust. Various purposes may be delineated, but coherence must be sought.
The following are a few examples of purposes that may be specified:

* To operate a secure platform \[or by using another technological
solution\] to allow data sharing;

* To enable the sharing of data between \[specify the
organizations\] in order to promote innovation or development in the
social economy sector;

* To document and identify the determinants of social activities
(consumption of specific goods, urban travel habits, etc.) in order to
promote the development of the social economy;

* To use data and artificial intelligence to find innovative
solutions to challenges met by social economy organizations.

Although the purpose can be solely decided by the settlor, we suggest
involving as many stakeholders as possible in this process, as well as
representatives of civil society to ensure diverse representation and to
enhance trust.  

## Flexibility within permanence

When dealing with technological platforms, standards and norms, along
with anonymization and analysis of data, we must necessarily consider
flexibility within the governance model. In this regard as well,
Québec’s trust offers some interesting features.

Social trust is a private instrument, meaning that no particular law or
public body monitors its creation, existence or functioning. A few rules
can be found in the *Civil Code of Québec*, but the greatest part of the
governance design is left to the imagination and the will of the
settlor. This means that many kinds of trust, social trusts and social
data trusts can be created, every one of which has its particular role,
features and bodies of governance.

Such specificity allows for important flexibility in technological
innovation and its governing ethical principles. This legal architecture
reflects the alliance of flexibility and permanence by incorporating
specific and non-modifiable legal duties for trustees while providing
for the evolution of norms, ethical principles and standards. In this
regard, trustees bear one permanent and mandatory duty: to constantly
evaluate and ensure that these norms, principles and standards are in
compliance with the best practices and the highest standards in terms of
privacy laws that are in place at the time. This mechanism allows
trustees to be held to a higher accountability than those operating
under the current law in force.

The suggested legal architecture that allows that harmonization between
flexibility and permanence is composed of:

1. **Laws** The *Civil
Code of Québec* defines the concept of trust and its core elements,
while the *Act Respecting the Protection of Personal Information in the
Private Sector* defines the difference between personal and non-personal
information and the obligations of organizations collecting personal
data relating to privacy.

2. **Constituting Act**
The Constituting Act is a binding instrument that defines the purpose of
the trust, trustees’ duties and powers and the general governance model.
As for the purpose of the trust, only the court “may \[...\] substitute,
for the original purpose of the trust, a purpose as nearly like it as
possible.”[^2]

[^2]: Article 1294 of the *Civil Code of Québec*.

3. **Charter of principles** Adopting a charter that sets out the main principles
of data governance and implements these principles is a crucial duty of
trustees. A data governance charter of principles (or declaration of
principles) is “an effective way to articulate and demonstrate adherence
to a set of values or positions on data governance.”[^3]

4. **Management framework**: Under the Charter, trustees must adopt a management
framework with mechanisms for accessing, sharing and protecting data and
handling requests for the withdrawal of personal information.

**Responsibility, accountability and trust**

Trust law represents the highest level of duties that can be imposed
upon a person in detention of the properties of others. Trustees are
bound by duties of prudence and diligence and must act honestly and
faithfully in the best interest of the purpose of the
trust.[^4]

[^4]: Article 1309 of the *Civil Code of Québec*.

Furthermore, trust law provides for additional monitoring and control
mechanisms that ensure responsibility and accountability. In our
opinion, this accountability reinforces trust.[^5] We suggest
that these mechanisms be implemented according to the following
descriptions:

[^5]: See Gagnon-Turcotte, S., Sculthorp, M., & Coutts, S. (2021). [*Digital data partnerships: Building the foundations for collaborative data governance in the public interest*](https://opennorth.ca/fr/publications/1e9rhhxmmlkhdngj1a7gsz_fr). Open North.

* **Trustees are identifiable physical persons**. One advantage of trust law is that it
identifies a physical person as being bound by strong legal duties.
However, since no public bodies monitor the creation and functioning of
social trusts, public transparency with regard to the identity and
nomination of trustees is crucial.

* **Accountability of trustees and ‘auditability’ of decisions**. A key aspect of social
trusts is that they provide for the annual accounting of the actions and
decisions of the trustees.[^6] Traditionally, accountability
in a trust is primarily financial. However, accountability for other
aspects is conceivable, such as documenting the various uses of the
datasets, and assessing the quality of the data and/or the technological
infrastructure that supports it. The governance model we designed
includes various levels within the accountability process, and the
creation of an ethical committee (the ¨Trust Protector¨) helps to
implement this mechanism, at its highest level. Accountability to the
public, in general, may also be provided through publicizing the various
decisions and actions of trustees.

[^6]: Article 1351 of the *Civil Code of Québec.*


* **Control over data**. Trusts create an alternative legal regime to ownership. Indeed, no one
has any right or ownership over data in trust. However,  the absence of
ownership does not mean the absence of control. Trustees are able to
make all decisions about accessing, hosting, protecting and sharing the
data within parameters that are either predetermined (notably with
regard to the purpose and key principles that are unchangeable, such as
respect for the autonomy and privacy of individuals), or evolving
(charter of data governance principles, more technical norms and
standards).

* **Implication of stakeholders in the governance of the trust**. The flexibility of trust law
allows for governance models that include the participation of
stakeholders and/or the general public in the decision-making process
and in any ‘auditability’ framework (through decisional committees or
nomination of trustees, for example). This inclusion of diverse
stakeholders allows for the establishment
