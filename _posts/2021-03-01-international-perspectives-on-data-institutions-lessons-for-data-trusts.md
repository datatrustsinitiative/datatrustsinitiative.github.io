Governments across the world have looked to data trusts as a new form of
data institution, aiming to support data sharing for social benefit
while managing potential harms from data use. In developing policy
frameworks for data trusts, researchers and policymakers can draw
lessons from the different approaches to data governance that are being
established across different jurisdictions. Our
<a href="/s/WP-2-DTI-global-perspectives.pdf" target="_blank">second
Working Paper</a> explores international perspectives on the development
of data institutions. This blog summarises some of the key themes –

## Different jurisdictions provide different legislative frameworks for data institutions

A prerequisite for the establishment of data trusts is that individuals
have rights over data about them that can be held in trust. Countries
and regions of the world differ in the types of right that are available
under current legislative frameworks. For example: 

- In the EU, personal data rights – including rights of access, erasure
  and portability between providers – are provided under the General
  Data Protection Regulation. 

- In Canada, data protection laws exist at both federal and provincial
  levels, with different frameworks for public sector data and private
  sector data. Adding to this framework, proposed legislative changes
  through the Consumer Privacy Protection Act would bring de-identified
  data within the scope of data governance frameworks. 

- In South Africa, data rights are created through both data protection
  legislation and constitutional provisions, based in human rights law,
  as well as database laws. 

- In the US, few personal data rights exist through federal law. At
  state-level, there are examples of data protection-like legislation.
  In California, for example, the California Consumer Privacy Act seeks
  to give individuals control over the type of information that is
  collected about them by businesses. 

While the UK has a long history of trust law to manage the rights and
responsibilities associated with different types of asset, the
availability of equivalent legal frameworks varies across countries.
Where trust law – as understood in common law jurisdictions – is not
available, there are usually alternative legal frameworks that can
foster independent stewardship and enable collective action, while
providing institutional safeguards. In the US, for example, the Delaware
Statutory Trust Act could provide a framework for data trusts; in
Quebec, the legal framework for Quebec Trusts could be adapted to
develop data trusts from a civil law perspective. 

## Institutional design needs to reflect local needs and opportunities

The term ‘data trust’ is now widely used to describe a collection of
different approaches to data governance. The Data Trusts Initiative
takes as its starting point that a data trust is a mechanism for
individuals to pool their data rights into an organisation that:
provides independent stewardship of those data rights; embeds fiduciary
responsibilities in its ways of working; operates within a frameworks of
institutional safeguards; and facilitates collective action. 

Thinking in terms of these core characteristics can help identify
relevant legal frameworks across different jurisdictions. It can also
highlight areas where further clarity is needed, if data trusts are to
operate effectively in these different jurisdictions, including: 

- What rights can be asserted in different jurisdictions, how do these
  rights interact with each other, and how they can be settled in a data
  trust;

- What value can data trusts add to the local data governance
  environment, based on its history, stakeholders and needs;

- The purposes for which data trusts might be better suited than other
  legal mechanisms for data stewardship;

- Why or how different stakeholders might be incentivised to – or
  disincentivised from – creating a data trust, and what value data
  trusts create for those stakeholders.

Jurisdictions differ in the rights they provide, and communities will
differ in their ambitions for data use. Data trust pilot projects will
need to adapt to these differing circumstances, operating within local
regulatory frameworks and responding to user demands. In some contexts,
there may be opportunities to build on existing civic institutions to
create new data institutions. In the US, [for
example](http://ide.mit.edu/news-blog/blog/qa-sandy-pentland-data-cooperatives%2010),
companies that have built electricity infrastructure and social credit
unions could benefit from creating data trusts to govern the data they
hold and direct its use for community benefit.

## Data trusts should enable innovation while managing risks

A range of different approaches to collective data governance challenges
have emerged across jurisdictions, from [cooperatives that manage data
from gig workers](https://www.driversseat.co) to trusts to [distribute
equity
benefits](https://www.bloombergquint.com/gadfly/airbnb-host-endowment-could-transform-sharing-%20economy)
from data-driven companies. These initiatives illustrate the diverse
operational issues that data trusts must navigate, which we explored in
our <a href="/s/Working-Paper-1-data-trusts-from-theory-to-practice.pdf"
target="_blank">previous Working Paper</a> and which include: 

- Developing business models for long-term sustainability; 

- Designing technical architectures for data access or management; 

- Creating methods of participatory governance; 

- Negotiating perceptions of trustworthiness; 

- Distributing benefits from trust activities. 

Coming years will likely bring a variety of experiments around new forms
of community-focused data governance. While pursuing these innovations,
those leading such projects have a responsibility to consider how their
work can best respond to community needs and what happens if these
projects fail.

Taking data trusts from theory to practice will require further work to
design ways of working and to safely pilot data trusts methods. In
taking forward this agenda, there are opportunities to learn from
experiences of different countries about which approaches work in
different contexts.
