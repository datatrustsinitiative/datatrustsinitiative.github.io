Responding to recent debates about the use of data to track the spread
of COVID-19 (and the ethical issues that follow), [this
article](https://www.ft.com/content/d6c877cc-6cfa-11ea-9bca-bf503995cd6f?shareType=nongift)
and [this
letter](https://www.ft.com/content/eaebfcb2-6e8d-11ea-9bca-bf503995cd6f?shareType=nongift)
to the Financial Times make the case for further efforts to develop
data stewardship mechanisms, such as data trusts.

A recent [article by The
Economist](https://www.economist.com/special-report/2020/02/20/who-will-benefit-most-from-the-data-economy)
explores the role of data trusts and cooperatives in helping share the
benefits of the data economy across society.

A [2020 paper for the Harvard Business
Review](https://hbr.org/2020/01/why-companies-make-it-so-hard-for-users-to-control-their-data)
explores some of the different ways that individuals can regain a sense
of 'ownership' over their data.

In this 2019 [letter to the Financial
Times](https://www.ft.com/content/33926828-16c0-11ea-9ee4-11f260415385),
Neil Lawrence and Sylvie Delacroix argue that, by pooling their data in
Trusts, individuals can gain an economic and political voice in debates
about data use.

In the context of debates about the development of civic data trusts to
manage smart cities data, [this
blog](https://www.cigionline.org/articles/reclaiming-data-trusts) at the
Centre for International Governance Innovation - and [this
video](https://www.cigionline.org/multimedia/data-trusts-defining-what-how-and-who-can-use-your-data) -
explores what a data trust is and the policy challenges it poses.

Exploring the results of some [pilot data trust
projects](https://theodi.org/article/odi-data-trusts-report/) by the
Open Data Institute, this [2019 article in the Financial
Times](https://www.ft.com/content/a683b8e4-a3ef-11e9-a282-2df48f366f7d)
considers questions about data privacy and governance, and the role for
data trusts as a governance tool.

A [2019 blogpost by
Nesta](https://www.nesta.org.uk/blog/new-ecosystem-trust/) considers the
role that trusts, cooperatives, and other mechanisms can play in
creating an ecosystem of trust.

Responding to debates about whether data can be treated as property -
and whether this matters - [this
blog](https://www.law.ox.ac.uk/research-and-subject-groups/property-law/blog/2019/10/data-trusts-and-defining-property)
considers the legal basis for such discussions.

A [2016 article for The
Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/media-network/2016/jun/03/data-trusts-privacy-fears-feudalism-democracy)
suggests that data trusts could play a role in alleviating concerns
around privacy, drawing inspiration from the creation of land societies
as a means of empowering individuals to negotiate with powerful actors.
