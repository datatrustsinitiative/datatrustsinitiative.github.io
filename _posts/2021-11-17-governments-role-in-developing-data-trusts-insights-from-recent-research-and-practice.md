*What role should government play in supporting data trusts? In ‘Data: A
new direction’ the UK’s Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport
is seeking views about the policy interventions needed to encourage
trustworthy data use through data intermediaries. Drawing lessons from
recent work on data trusts, this post suggests three areas for action.*

In September 2021, the UK Government published a consultation on
proposals to reform the UK’s data protection regime. [With the aim of
creating](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-launches-data-reform-to-boost-innovation-economic-growth-and-protect-the-public) “*an
ambitious, pro-growth and innovation-friendly data protection regime
that underpins the trustworthy use of data*”, the [consultation](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1022315/Data_Reform_Consultation_Document__Accessible_.pdf) is
seeking views on which strategies can encourage data-enabled innovation
across sectors, while maintaining high data protection standards.
Reflecting growing interest in their role as data stewards, data
intermediaries – and the role of government in supporting them – feature
prominently in the areas considered by the consultation.

This focus on data intermediaries as a solution to current data sharing
challenges aligns with policy developments we’ve seen across the world
(and explored previously on this blog). The [EU’s Data Governance
Act](https://datatrusts.uk/blogs/data-trusts-and-the-draft-data-governance-act) has
been developing a framework for governing data intermediaries, putting
in place safeguards to ensure that they remain a neutral platform for
data sharing, that participants have mechanisms to hold intermediaries
to account if they fail in their services, and that they meet minimum
standards for access and participation. [India’s Committee of Experts on
Non-Personal
Data](https://datatrusts.uk/blogs/where-next-for-proposals-from-indias-committee-of-experts-on-non-personal-data-in-conversation-with-astha-kapoor-and-sylvie-delacroix) has
been exploring how data intermediaries could provide a tool for
communities to exert their data rights, and whether government should be
able to mandate data sharing. And a series of consultations in [Canada](https://datatrusts.uk/blogs/international-policy-developments) have
investigated what interventions could strengthen existing data rights or
increase the enforcement powers of regulatory authorities.  

Data trusts are a form of data intermediary. Drawing from recent work by
the [Centre for Data Ethics and
Innovation](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/unlocking-the-value-of-data-exploring-the-role-of-data-intermediaries/unlocking-the-value-of-data-exploring-the-role-of-data-intermediaries),
the UK Government describes their role as providing “fiduciary data
stewardship on behalf of data subjects”. This builds on research by
the [Ada Lovelace Institute and
AI
Council](https://www.adalovelaceinstitute.org/report/legal-mechanisms-data-stewardship/),
which considered that “the distinctive elements of this model are the
role of the trustee, who bears a fiduciary duty in exercising data
rights (or the beneficial interest in those rights) on behalf of the
beneficiaries, and the role of the overseeing court in providing
additional safeguards.” In line with recent papers by [the Global Partnership on
AI,](https://ceimia.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2021-07-09-GPAI-summary-understanding-data-trusts-updated.docx.pdf) at
the Data Trusts Initiative we see data trusts as playing a particular
role in empowering individuals and communities to set the terms of data
use by engaging a trustee to act on their behalf. 

Even amongst data intermediaries, the data trusts community is
nascent. [A recent
survey](https://gpai.ai/projects/data-governance/data-trusts/enabling-data-sharing-for-social-benefit-data-trusts-interim-report.pdf) by
the Open Data Institute and Aapti Institute found that 80% of data
trusts projects were less than 5 years old or yet to be operational. As
research and practice in this area evolve, there remain a lot of areas
where our understanding of how to operationalise data trusts are in
flux. This time last year, the Data Trusts Initiative published our
first Working Paper investigating where further insights were needed to
move data trusts from theory to practice. This highlighted [a number of core
areas](https://datatrusts.uk/blogs/moving-from-theory-to-practice-how-do-we-create-real-world-data-trusts) where
further insights where needed – about where data trusts fit in the wider
governance landscape; what safeguards can help ensure accountability;
which interventions can increase accessibility; and what business models
can ensure sustainability. The research projects we’re supporting are
investigating these areas in further detail.  

While the community is making progress in understanding these issues,
lots remains uncertain. In an environment where knowledge and practice
are in flux, and the role of government is not clear, what action can
policymakers take?

One approach to answering that question is to look for ‘no regrets’
steps – policy interventions that can be made now in the context of high
uncertainty, because they deliver benefits across multiple future
pathways for the development of data intermediaries. 

Recent insights from our research projects, and work by our partners in
the community including [the
Global Partnership for AI, Open Data Institute, and Aapti
Institute](https://gpai.ai/projects/data-governance/data-trusts/enabling-data-sharing-for-social-benefit-data-trusts-interim-report.pdf),
point to three areas where government intervention could support the
development of data trusts on a ‘no regrets’ basis:

- Creating an enabling environment;

- Securing the legislative foundations; and

- Developing safeguards for innovation.

**Creating an enabling environment.** Data trusts – and other data
intermediaries – are one component of a wider data sharing ecosystem.
Their success will rely on enablers from that ecosystem – enablers that
boost individual, organisational and societal ‘data readiness’.
Individuals will need data literacy skills to help make sense of the
ways in which their data are used, and to assess the value propositions
of different data intermediaries. Organisations, meanwhile, will need
sufficient data maturity to be able to make use of potentially valuable
data they hold. This wider environment is shaped by policy levers – in
education and skills; data standards and sharing policies; and support
for businesses and civil society – that government can use to create an
enabling environment for data intermediaries. 

**Securing the legislative foundations.** Data rights and the ability to
implement a regime of strong fiduciary duties are a prerequisite for
data trusts (explored in more detail by the Aapti Institute [here](https://gpai.ai/projects/data-governance/data-trusts/enabling-data-sharing-for-social-benefit-data-trusts-interim-report.pdf)).
While the UK’s current data rights regime does make provision for a
range of data rights, we repeatedly see questions about the extent of
those rights, the ways individuals can exercise them, and what types of
fiduciary duty can be supported by different legal mechanisms. When
reviewing the UK’s data protection regime, there is an opportunity for
Government to bolster the legislative foundations that will enable data
trusts, by clarifying the scope of current data rights and enhancing
enabling rights, such as portability. For example, action now to clarify
which data rights can be mandated to a data trustee (and under which
conditions) would help resolve some of the uncertainties that data trust
pioneers are navigating.

**Developing safeguards for innovation.** Central to the next phase of
developing data trusts will be innovation in operational strategies, as
practitioners figure out ‘what works’ in terms of defining, implementing
and sustaining these new forms of data stewardship. This process may
test the boundaries of current regulatory regimes; it may also highlight
a range of new failure modes for data stewardship, or create new
vulnerabilities or forms of exploitation. An important area for
attention is the development of safeguards that can support innovation
while managing risk to individuals, and while allowing unsuccessful
projects to fail safely. This may require regulatory testbeds, forms of
assurance or codes of conduct, or interventions that ensure no section
of society is left behind from the benefits of data trusts (or
disproportionately exposed to risks).

As the community matures – and specific regulatory needs become clearer,
either in relation to data trusts themselves or their application in
specific sectors – the data trust policy agenda will expand. In the
meantime, these ‘no regrets’ steps offer a route for Government to start
building the data trust policy environment now, taking an adaptive
approach to policy and regulation as the pathway for developing this
form of data intermediary becomes clearer.
