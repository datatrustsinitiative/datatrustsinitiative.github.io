abstract: |
  Achieving the promise of the digital economy will require robust
  data governance frameworks that allow data sharing – helping develop
  new data-enabled products and services – while protecting individual
  rights and freedoms. In pursuit of this aim, the Data Trusts
  Initiative welcomes the opportunity to response to this consultation
  on the draft Data Governance Act.

  * A variety of legal tools to support data sharing already exist,
    based on contractual, cooperative or corporate structures.

  * Data Trusts differ from the above in that they rely on the legal
    framework provided by trust law. A data trust is a mechanism for
    individuals to take the data rights that are set out in law and
    pool these into an organisation – a trust – in which trustees make
    decisions about data use on their behalf. While trust law was
    developed in common law jurisdictions, its principles and
    practices have equivalents across jurisdictions that could be used
    as the basis for data trusts.

  * Data trusts offer important lessons for the design of trustworthy
    data governance institutions, highlighting the type of safeguards
    that could be used to ensure the safe and effective operation of
    data intermediaries. For example:

    * The fiduciary duties created by trust law require that trustees
      act with undivided loyalty for the beneficiaries of the trust.

    * Courts are able to intervene if a trustee fails in their duties, providing
      further safeguards.

  * Since publication of the draft Act, there have been questions
    about the way in which Recital 24 might affect the operation of
    data intermediaries such as data trusts – in particular, concerns
    about whether it would be possible to delegate rights under the
    GDPR to a data trustee. In this respect, it is important to note
    that the creation of a data trust need not require the transfer of
    rights. Data trusts can be designed in ways that ensure
    individuals retain the ability to remove their rights from trusts,
    with safeguards that ensure the trust operates in ways that
    support enfranchisement.

  * A more complete exploration of the issues about delegation and
    transfer of rights can be found at:
