title: "Containing Multitudes: Aggregating Personal Data Access Contracts to Create a Bottom-Up Data Trust"
abstract: |
  Data-driven technologies and digital business models have proved
  transformative to the economy, creating great wealth and reshaping
  entire industries. However, while data has been a fundamental
  resource of this digital transformation, data cannot be considered
  property.

  This presents a problem regarding personal data – the data generated
  by or on individuals as they interact with digitally enabled
  systems. This information can be both valuable and highly
  sensitive. Despite this, individuals are unable to directly control
  the flow of this data, or receive value for its use. Subject to the
  commercial decision-making of data collecting institutions,
  individuals are ill-equipped either to protect their data privacy,
  or participate on equal terms in the data marketplace.

  According to Ng, the inability of individuals to express rights over
  this data prevents economic optimality. Should clear property rights
  exist in personal data, negative externalities around privacy and
  data exploitation can be solved more efficiently. However, given the
  right technical framework, the necessary individual legal
  entitlements over information can be expressed and optimality
  achieved.

  This paper examines how digital property rights for individuals can
  be used in the context of the ‘data trust’ to generate collectivist
  solutions to asymmetries in the personal data market.
