abstract: |
  Organisations, governments and citizen-driven initiatives around the
  world aspire to use data to tackle major societal and economic
  problems, such as combating the COVID-19 pandemic. Realising the
  potential of data for social good is not an easy task, and from the
  outset efforts must be made to develop methods for the responsible
  management of data on behalf of individuals and groups.

  Widespread misuse of personal data, exemplified by repeated
  high-profile data breaches and sharing scandals, has resulted in
  ‘tenuous’ public trust1 in public and private-sector data
  sharing. Concentration of power and market dominance, based on
  extractive data practices from a few technological players, both
  entrench public concern about data use and impede data sharing and
  access in the public interest. The lack of transparency and scrutiny
  around public-private partnerships add additional layers of concerns
  when it comes to how data is used. Part of these concerns comes from
  the fact that what individuals might consider to be ‘good’ is
  different to how those who process data may define it, especially if
  individuals have no say in that definition.
