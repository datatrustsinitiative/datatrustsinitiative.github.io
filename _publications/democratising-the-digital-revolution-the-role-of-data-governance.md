abstract: |
  As more data is created from a growing range of digitally mediated
  interactions, there are opportunities to use data in policy - from
  nowcasting metrics for economic performance, to the design of
  targeted public-health interventions. Many of these new forms of
  data are the result of happenstance; they are generated by
  individual citizens in the course of daily activities, without
  having been collected with a public policy goal in mind. While use
  of such data can create significant benefits, its use also brings
  new potential forms of harm and risks, further disenfranchising
  individuals in decisions about data sharing and use. In this
  context, there is a demand for institutions that can bridge the
  desire to share data for social and economic benefit, with concerns
  about the vulnerabilities that such data sharing can create.

  Data trusts offer a framework for creating such institutions and
  bringing citizen voices into decisions about data use. These trusts
  have been the subject of widespread policy attention in recent
  years, but there remain important challenges to be addressed in
  moving discussions from theory to practice. Central to the next
  phase of development for data trusts will be the creation of pilot
  projects to experiment with ways of working and forms of citizen
  engagement. Data trusts will need to seek ways of aligning
  incentives between individuals, groups and organisations; of
  ensuring that they are accessible to all in society; and of engaging
  effectively with their members in new forms of participatory
  governance.
