title: "International perspectives on the development of data institutions"
section: Working Papers
abstract: |
  Data acquires value through use; it can create tailored projects and
  services for individuals, streamline organisational processes, and
  improve the delivery of public administration. The magnitude of the
  potential economic and social benefits that follow demand action to
  create frameworks and mechanisms that enable data sharing for public
  benefit. At the same time, these shifting patterns of data
  generation and use create new vulnerabilities for individuals,
  communities and society.

  With the ambition of harnessing the value of data for economic and
  social benefit, while preventing citizens being exposed to new forms
  of data-enabled harm, governments across the world have looked to
  data trusts as a new model of data institution. In creating these
  data trusts, lessons can be drawn from comparing the approaches and
  legal models that are being established across different
  jurisdictions.

  A workshop convened by the Data Trusts Initiative on 28 January 2021
  set out to explore how discussions about data trusts are progressing
  across different jurisdictions and the insights that these
  international perspectives offer for the future development of data
  institutions.
description: This Working Paper considers what lessons for the future of data trusts can be drawn from  experiences of establishing  data institutions in different jurisdictions.
