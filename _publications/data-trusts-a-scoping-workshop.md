  In September 2019 The Alan Turing Institute and Jesus College
  Intellectual Forum co-convened a workshop to explore the potential
  of Trust law as a framework for enabling careful stewardship of data
  use. This note summarises discussions at the workshop. It is not
  intended as a verbatim record, and does not reflect an agreed
  position by workshop participants.
