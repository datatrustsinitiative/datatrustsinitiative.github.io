title: "Data Trusts: moving from theory to practice"
section: Working Papers
abstract: |
  The challenge of data governance in the 21st century
  is to bridge aspirations to share data for personal or public
  benefit with concerns about the harms to individuals, communities
  and society that can emerge from data (mis)use. Current legislative
  frameworks already create a constellation of data rights to mitigate
  against these harms, but exercising these rights can be difficult,
  demanding time, resources and expertise that are out of reach for
  many. By empowering individuals to assert their data rights, data
  trusts offer a way for individuals and groups to influence how and
  why organisations are able to use data about them. However, despite
  much recent excitement surrounding the role data trusts could play
  in creating trustworthy data governance institutions, gaps in
  understanding about the form and function of these trusts remain.

  A workshop convened by the Data Trusts Initiative on 26 November
  2020 set out to explore the areas in which further work is needed to
  advance the development of data trusts, delineating the questions
  where interdisciplinary research can help make progress in
  establishing data trusts that respond to real-world challenges.
