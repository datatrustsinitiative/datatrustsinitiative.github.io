abstract: |
  The challenge for data governance in the 21st century is to bridge
  aspirations to share data for personal or public benefit with
  concerns about the harms to individuals, communities and society
  that can emerge from data (mis)use. Achieving these aspirations
  requires governance structures that enable data access, while
  managing the rights and responsibilities associated with different
  data types. In this article, we explore the role that data trusts
  can play in bridging this governance gap.
