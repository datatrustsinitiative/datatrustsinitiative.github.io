abstract: |
  Computational biologists know better than perhaps any other domain
  the importance of data sharing in progress in understanding complex
  decisions.  Underlying the revolution in “artificial intelligence”
  is really a revolution in data. But when data is persona or has
  legal protections placed upon there are challenges to data
  sharing. In this talk we introduce the ideas behind data sharing and
  the model of data trusts, an approach to data sharing that relies on
  trust law to form its governance structure.

  These notes give background to a 10 minute talk on Data Trusts given
  at the Human Cell Atlas Meeting. For more information on this work
  you can check our recently announced “Data Trusts Initiative” and
  the associated website.
