  At this year's summit, G7 leaders reiterated their commitment to
  promoting a human-centric approach to Artificial Intelligence (AI)
  and to supporting forms of data governance that enable the
  widespread use of data for public benefit. Identifying and
  understanding the data stewardship approaches that can support
  human-centric AI are central to GPAI's data governance work. GPAI's
  members are brought together by a shared commitment to the values
  set out in the OECD Recommendation on Artificial Intelligence, and
  to the development of AI that is rooted in the principles of human
  rights, inclusion, diversity, innovation, and economic growth.

  Progress in AI requires access to data, and data stewardship offers
  an important lever in shaping how AI technologies develop. Who
  shares data, for what purpose, and for whose benefit are central to
  the development of trustworthy $\mathrm{AI}$ technologies. With
  these questions in mind, our new project, Enabling data sharing for
  social benefit through data trusts, is investigating how new forms
  of data stewardship can enable access to data for innovation while
  putting citizen interests at the heart of data stewardship.

  Different approaches to data stewardship already exist, supported by
  a variety of data institutions that help different users access data
  under controlled conditions. The term 'data institution' is
  generally used to refer to an established structure that stewards
  data on behalf of a community. These fulfil different functions:
  some might act as an intermediary organisation offering data
  management services; some might pool data for common use; others
  might take the form of an 'escrow' service that manages how
  different parties interact with data resources.

  Data institutions can take different forms. In some cases, they
  might be a set of technologies that govern how data can be accessed
  or processed. In others, they could be a set of legal agreements and
  organisational practices that determine how decisions about data use
  are made. In some cases, institutions might have a formal legal
  basis, being officially incorporated as an organisation, but a
  variety of other relationships or data sharing regimes might also
  form the basis of a data institution.
