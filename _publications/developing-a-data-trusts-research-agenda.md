title: "Developing a Data Trusts Research Agenda"
section: Working Papers
abstract: |
  Despite much progress in establishing the case for data trusts as a
  necessary innovation in data stewardship, important questions remain
  about the function and form that such trusts should take when
  responding to real-world challenges. Addressing these questions
  requires further work to clarify how data trusts fit in the current
  data governance landscape, and to identify the operational
  strategies that can ensure their success.

  To better understand how data trusts can be taken from theory to
  practice, the Data Trusts Initiative is funding seven research
  projects that each address a gap in current understandings. These
  projects ask:
  - What do recent use cases tell us about operational strategies for
    data trusts?
  - How can legal mechanisms associated with data trusts enhance
    participation in healthcare research?
  - How might data trusts operate in the urban context?
  - How can data trusts support civic engagement and environmental
    stewardship in local communities?
  - How can data trusts be created in civil law jurisdictions?
  - Does the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) allow
    individuals to mandate their data rights to a trust (or other data
    intermediary)?
  - What combination of technical and legal infrastructure can give
    individuals more control over data about them?

  A workshop convened by the Data Trusts Initiative on 29 June 2021
  brought together the leaders of these research projects, to explore
  current issues in their work. While each considers a different
  aspect of data trust theory or practice, across the projects the
  following areas of shared interest emerge:
  - Understanding the nature of the legal landscape - the rights that
    exist in different jurisdictions and the legal environment in
    which data trusts might operate - and the implications of this for
    how data trusts manage data and data rights.
  - Exploring the points of interaction between individuals and data
    trusts, identifying the interventions necessary to ensure data
    trusts are accessible to all and effective at representing their
    beneficiaries.
  - Characterising the tensions that will arise in data trust design
    and identifying pathways to negotiate these tensions.
