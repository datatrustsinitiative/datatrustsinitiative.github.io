title: Enabling Data Sharing for Social Benefit Through Data Trusts
description: |
  This project was established to support the creation of real-world
  data trusts that enable data sharing for social benefit. It supports
  new institutions that empower individuals and communities to enact
  their data rights, ensuring that data sharing activities reflect the
  diverse interests of all in society. The end goal is to help GPAI
  realise the potential of data trusts as a tool to promote the safe,
  fair, legal and equitable sharing of data, in service of the UN
  Sustainable Development Goals.

abstract: |
  According to the World Meteorological Organization, 2019 concluded a
  decade of exceptional global heat, retreating ice and record sea
  levels driven by greenhouse gases produced by human activities.

  Data and artificial intelligence have a vital role to play in
  helping us understand and tackle this climate crisis, from
  predicting extreme weather events, to improving the energy
  efficiency of our homes and helping to identify deforestation.

  However, as with data systems at large, individuals and communities
  tend to have little say in how data is collected, used and shared
  for climate action. Data trusts and other forms of ‘bottom-up’ data
  stewardship have emerged to reverse this trend and empower people to
  take part in the data economy.

  This report sets out the work undertaken for the project ‘Data
  trusts in climate’, completed between November 2021 and
  March 2022. The project was commissioned by the Global Partnership
  on Artificial Intelligence (GPAI) and delivered in partnership by
  the Open Data Institute (ODI) and Aapti Institute, with support from
  the Data Trusts Initiative. It consisted of a literature review,
  expert interviews and a co-design process involving more than 50
  organisations from around the world.

  We articulate a design for a London Cycling Data Trust, describing
  how it could interact with the cycling community, be legally
  incorporated, the technologies it could use and its options for
  funding. We found that data trusts will be less feasible in other
  contexts and difficult to apply for a variety of reasons, including
  ones of cultural, technological and economic nature. We set out
  lessons learned from exploring data trusts for small shareholder
  farming in India and for indigenous climate migration in Peru.
  
  This work has produced a set of generic feasibility criteria for
  data trusts, which are intended for use by policymakers and
  practitioners seeking to understand where data trusts may be
  necessary and possible, in climate change and beyond. It also sets
  out a practical roadmap for the development of a London Cycling Data
  Trust and other similar data trusts, outlining the steps required to
  implement it in the real world.

  We also discuss other approaches to responsible data stewardship for
  AI, and options for GPAI and other policymakers interested in this
  agenda.

  As in all progress around new approaches to data stewardship, it is
  essential to test these ideas further. This project is another step
  forward for data trusts, but much more is required to unlock their
  potential.
