<h2>Data Trust Pilots unveiled!</h2>
<p>The Data Trusts Initiative is pleased to introduce our first cohort
of <strong>data trust pioneers</strong> who will be leading the creation
  of real-world data trusts in 2022.</p>

<p>By putting citizen voices at the heart of decisions about data use,
data trusts offer a vehicle for communities to set the terms of data
use. For the last year, the Data Trusts Initiative has been
investigating how to move the debate about data trusts from theory to
practice. Most of today’s questions about what exactly a data trust is
or how data trusts work can only be resolved by trialling data trusts
methods in practice. We’re delighted today to be announcing the next
phase of our work, which will support two new data trust pilot
projects.</p>

<p>The <strong>Brixham Data Trust</strong> seeks to empower the
community of the small fishing town of Brixham, Devon UK, to exercise
their data rights. Led by Natasha Nicholson and Pamela Charlick
(charlick+nicholson architects), this pilot project will seek the
community’s views on how data could facilitate placemaking and address
environmental stewardship, health, wellbeing and net-zero ambitions. The
pilot will support collective decision-making about how to deploy local
data resources to deliver benefits for the community.</p>
<p>‘Our ambition is that this data trust pilot lays the foundation for a
new data ecosystem in Brixham, building the community’s capacity to use
and share data securely in ways that benefit local people and
organisations.’ <em>(Natasha Nicholson, Brixham Data Trust)</em></p>

<p>The <strong>Born in Scotland Data Trust</strong>, led by Jessica Bell
(University of Warwick), Rebecca Reynolds (University of Edinburgh) and
Ann Hagell (<a href="https://www.youngpeopleshealth.org.uk">The
Association for Young People’s Health</a>) will build an infrastructure
for trustworthy data stewardship around a pilot birth cohort study that
ultimately seeks to tackle the economic and healthcare inequalities
affecting communities in Scotland. Stewarding healthcare, administrative
and social data collected from pregnant women and their children, this
pilot project will explore how data trusts can give research
participants, including young people, a voice in decisions about data
use.</p>

<p><em>‘We believe data trusts can help support crucial health data
research into pregnancy and childhood development, while at the same
time providing enhanced participation and more robust safeguards for
data and data rights.’ (Jessica Bell, Born in Scotland Data
Trust).</em></p>

<p>The <strong>General Practice Data Trust</strong> will be
investigating how data trusts could help steward healthcare data in the
UK. Building on recent work as part of the <a
href="http://cdip.lancs.ac.uk/" target="_blank"><span
style="text-decoration:underline">Civic Data Identity Platform
project</span></a>, Dr Sarah Devaney (University of Manchester) and the
Team will be building a data trust that brings bottom-up data
stewardship to NHS data.</p>

<p>The <a href="/pilot-projects-gpdata">GP Data Trust pilot</a> aims to
explore how to give back control of their data to over a million people
who have opted out of NHS Digital’s General Practice concerned about how
their data will be managed and used by the NHS (GPDPR) programme, and
enable them an opportunity to participate in life-saving research.</p>
<p>This inaugural cohort of data trust pilot projects will take the
first steps towards delivering data trusts that transform patterns of
data use, creating a new model of bottom-up data stewardship that
empowers individuals and communities. In the long-term, our ambition is
that these pilots help deliver the economic and social benefits of data
use while more effectively managing the harms or vulnerabilities that
new uses of data can create.</p>

<p>The Data Trusts Initiative will be working in partnership with the
pilots to develop advice, workshops and practitioner networks that help
navigate the operational challenges faced by those seeking to establish
data trusts.</p>

<p>The launch of these inaugural pilots marks a significant step in a
project that has taken us from theory to real-world deployment in three
fast-paced years. This rapid progression wouldn’t have been possible
without the support and advice of a variety of private, public and
not-for-profit actors who chose to champion the idea of ‘data trusts’
early on. We are grateful to the McGovern Foundation in particular for
giving us the means to turn this idea into reality.</p>
